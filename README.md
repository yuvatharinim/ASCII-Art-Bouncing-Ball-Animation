# ASCII-Art-Bouncing-Ball-Animation
A simple yet visually engaging C project that creates a console-based ASCII animation of a bouncing ball. It uses loops, basic math, and ANSI colors for dynamic motion—no external libraries needed, though it can be enhanced with **ncurses** for more advanced terminal control.
